WindowsFormsApp - imitation with pythonnet
==========================================

This is an imitation of WindowsFormApp template from Visual Studio to be as
close as possible in means of directory and file structure, accessors, and
hierarchy using Python for .NET (pythonnet).

This is probably not the best way to use the pythonnet library and .NET
framework on python, but this was created as a future reference and also
For Funâ„¢.

The entry point is inside app.py, so run it with `python app.py` on Windows
with .NET Framework installed.
